# Humanitary

## Background

Humanitary is an application that aims to spread awareness about the world's most urgent crises and streamline the process of donations to these crises so that people affected by these crises can receive support quickly and effeciently.

The Humanitary app enables victims to share their own personal stories about​ ​the​ ​crisis, show​ ​photos​ ​of​ ​the​ ​devastation,​ ​and​ ​inform​ ​people​ ​about​ ​what​ ​is​ ​actually​ ​happening​ ​and​ ​what still​ ​needs​ ​to​ ​be​ ​done.​ ​By​ ​having​ ​a​ ​personalized​ ​connection​ ​to​ ​a​ ​particular​ ​crisis​ ​rather​ ​than​ ​just reading​ ​a​ ​headline​ ​about​ ​it,​ ​donors​ ​can​ ​get​ ​a​ ​true​ ​understanding​ ​of​ ​the​ ​crisis​ ​and​ ​hopefully​ ​feel more​ ​deeply​ ​connected​ ​to​ ​the​ ​people​ ​they​ ​are​ ​helping.​ ​Instead​ ​of​ ​donating​ ​to​ ​a​ ​large organization​ ​where​ ​it​ ​is​ ​not​ ​clear​ ​where,​ ​when,​ ​and​ ​to​ ​whom​ ​the​ ​money​ ​is​ ​distributed,​ ​donors will​ ​experience​ ​direct​ ​connections.​ ​The​ ​​Humanitary​​ ​app​ ​will​ ​enable​ ​the​ ​donor​ ​to​ ​communicate personally​ ​with​ ​the​ ​victims​ ​and​ ​learn​ ​exactly​ ​how​ ​their​ ​donation​ ​will​ ​help​ ​alleviate​ ​the​ ​problems caused​ ​by​ ​the​ ​various​ ​crises.​ ​The​ ​vision​ ​of​ ​this​ ​platform​ ​is​ ​to​ ​focus​ ​on​ ​the​ ​most​ ​troubling​ ​global crises​ ​that​ ​face​ ​society​ ​and​ ​to​ ​build​ ​a​ ​community​ ​of​ ​people​ ​who​ ​can​ ​empathize​ ​with​ ​these causes,​ ​who​ ​can​ ​make​ ​an​ ​effort​ ​to​ ​resolve​ ​them​ ​by​ ​spreading​ ​awareness,​ ​and​ ​who​ ​are​ ​willing​ ​to donate​ ​to​ ​various​ ​relief​ ​efforts.

## Technical Design

This application was built from the ground up using swift and node.js. For the backend, Google's firebase real time database was used. Swift was used to handle the IOS development of the application, while node.js was used to connect the app to google cloud functions to handle push notifications to user devices.
